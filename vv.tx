Thanks.



Now if I want to add another section to my system (an Accounting Section)
 which should be very very comprehensive and cover every single aspect of 
 my business such as expenses, revenue, invoices, clients debts, client balance, 
 profit and loss, employee salaries (which should also include deductions and bonus 
 along with everything related to them), and every other thing you think is professional 
 to have for a company in the accounting section.



what do you think? how can we start??

please tell me your thoughts.

1. Royal Can codes are different (eg, R1642).

2. Karwanchi codes are different (eg K333)

3. Zain Group codes are different (eg Z25)

4. Normal Clients does not use codes, but still they have their own invoice template and order form.



What to do:

- We should have different codes for each client (Royal Can, Karwanchi, and Zain Group)

- Each time a code is used for any of them, it should be reserved and be used again.

- Zain Group has its own invoice template and Order form as well. (we will discuss it later)

- I want to create another page called Codes. in this page there should be three tables. 
One Table for the usable codes for a specific Client, another table for the used codes for a 
specific Client along with their corresponding products, and another table for the codes that 
have been used, but changed and can be used again. For example we have used R1642 for a Royal Can order,
 but later we change the code to R1643. The old code should be availlable to use again and that is what 
 we put in the second table in the Codes Page. On top of the page, there should be Two things. A search bar 
 to search for a specific code or product and a dropdown menu to choose a client (either Royal Can, Karwanchi, or Zain Group) 
 to see their used codes, available codes, and teh codes that are usable again.



Do you fully understand? Do you have any questions before we begin? Do you know what to do?
